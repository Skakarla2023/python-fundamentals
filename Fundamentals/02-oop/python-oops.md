# Python OOP

- OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
- Python is an object-oriented language, allowing you to structure your code using classes and objects for better organization and reusability.

### Advantages of OOP

- Provides a clear structure to programs
- Makes code easier to maintain, reuse, and debug
- Helps keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Allows you to build reusable applications with less code

### Classes and Objects

- Classes define what an object looks like and an object is created according to that class.
- When you create an object from a class, it inherits all the variables and functions defined inside that class.
- To create class in python , we use the keyword class:

```python
class Main:
  x=5
```

- we can use that class to create objects.

```python
class Main():
  x=5

obj = Main()
print(obj.x)
```

- To delete the objects, use the del keyword.
